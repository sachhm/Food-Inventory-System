# food-inventory-system
A Java based solution based on organizing pantries

I have created this project as a potential solution for my own personal assistance. 
It serves as a simplified tool that organises the various foods in a pantry. 

Plans exist to have the final product as a fully functional web based GUI application that can sync to a database. 
For now, it is a simple CLI based program.
